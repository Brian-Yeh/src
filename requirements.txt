To set up, you need to make sure you have Node and npm installed on your machine.

If you are using OS X or Windows, Node.js can be downloaded from the following website: 

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install the version called LTS. 

You can test your installation by running the command:

node -v

The version should be the latest LTS version available. 

After installing Node.js, npm is automatically installed, but you should make sure that you have the latest version by running the command:

npm -v

If the latest version of npm is not installed, run the command: 

npm install npm@latest -g.

Now you should have the latest version of npm.

To see the front end running in our current setup, go into the project directory src and run:

npm install

This will add modules/packages that are needed to run our application. This is based on the package.json file.

Run the command:

 ./node_modules/.bin/nodemon

This starts a server at "http://localhost:3000/" that you can use to see the front end.
